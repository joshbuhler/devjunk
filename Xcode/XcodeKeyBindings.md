# Xcode Key Bindings

Key bindings are stored in `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/KeyBindings/`. Not all bindings appear to be stored in the `Default.idekeybindings` file. They may just need to be modified manually in the Xcode Preferences menu.

## Bindings to Add/Modify

Some bindings have crazy combos, so they are re-mapped to something easier to use. Others are useful and worth adding.

| Command  | Key Combo | Notes  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Stop Playground  | ^⌘↩ - Control-Command-Return |  |
| Perform Action > Test Again  | F12  | Simplifying the default combo |
| Move to End of Text Extending Selection | ⇧-End - Shift-End |  |
| Move to Beginning of Text Extending Selection | ⇧-Home - Shift-Home |  |
| Move to End of Text | End |  |
| Move to Beginning of Text | Home |  |

## Bindings to Remove
