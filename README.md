devjunk
=======

Small collection of dev junk I find useful and tend to setup on each of my dev machines. Color themes, scripts, config files, etc. Everything requiring a file is grouped into different folders, and some basic info about what's there is listed below. Honestly, this is more of a reference for me than anything else.


## Xcode
Customizations to Xcode, including color themes and key bindings. Currently using the `_Gotham.xccolortheme`

### Installing

1. Copy the contents of the `UserData` folder to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/`. Take care not to overwrite anything you don't plan to.
2. Restart Xcode.
3. Enjoy.


## Terminal
Themes that I like and use on a regular basis. Currently using "The Grid", a theme I created inspired by Tron Legacy.

### Installing themes
1. Open the "Profiles" tab in Terminal Preferences
2. Use the gear icon at the bottom of the profile selector, and select "Importâ€¦".
3. Import the theme you'd like, and select it.
4. Done.


## Sublime Text

### Key Bindings
Custom key bindings. Copy to `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User`

You'll also want to setup the command-line tool: https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/command_line.html#mac

### Packages
Install Package Control: https://packagecontrol.io/

Currently installed packages are included in this repo, but they should be updated after being installed. They should be installed to `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Installed Packages/`


## Git
A basic gitconfig file I use. Copy this file to `~/.gitconfig`, or copy/paste what you want from here into your existing `.gitconfig` file. Basically, it adds:

* Color coding
* A few shortcut aliases
* Setup for using [P4Merge][p4] as your mergetool
* [Sublime Text][subl] as your default editor

## Finder
QuickLook is pretty handy, but it can be pretty dumb at times, and isn't that useful if it doesn't recognize a file's extension, or if a file doesn't have one. The [QLStephen plugin][ql_1] is great for cases like this. If the file you're trying to take a look at is a plaintext file, you'll get a preview you can actually look at in Finder.
