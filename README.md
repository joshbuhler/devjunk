devjunk
=======

Small collection of dev junk I find useful and tend to setup on each of my dev machines. Color themes, scripts, config files, etc. Everything is grouped into different folders, and some basic info about what's there is listed below.




## ColorThemes

### Xcode
Themes that I like and use on a regular basis. Currently using the Dusk - Custom theme. (Real original name, right?)

#### Installing themes
1. Themes should be installed in Xcode's `FontAndColorThemes` folder (`~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/`).
2. Restart Xcode.
3. Enjoy.


### Terminal
Themes that I like and use on a regular basis. Currently using "The Grid", a theme I created inspired by Tron Legacy.

#### Installing themes
1. Open the "Profiles" tab in Terminal Preferences
2. Use the gear icon at the bottom of the profile selector, and select "Importâ€¦".
3. Import the theme you'd like, and select it.
4. Done.
