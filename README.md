devjunk
=======

Small collection of dev junk I find useful and tend to setup on each of my dev machines. Color themes, scripts, config files, etc. Everything requiring a file is grouped into different folders, and some basic info about what's there is listed below. Honestly, this is more of a reference for me than anything else.

## Bash
Small little additions to a `.bash_profile` file. Pretty sparse since I just cleaned a lot of old stuff out of it.

### tabname
A small command called `tabname` that allows you to name your tabs in Terminal. Usage is pretty simple:

    tabname "The Name of this tab"

## ColorThemes

### Xcode
Themes that I like and use on a regular basis. Currently using the `_Gotham.xccolortheme`

#### Installing themes
1. Themes should be installed in Xcode's `FontAndColorThemes` folder (`~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/`).
2. Restart Xcode.
3. Enjoy.


### Terminal
Themes that I like and use on a regular basis. Currently using "The Grid", a theme I created inspired by Tron Legacy.

#### Installing themes
1. Open the "Profiles" tab in Terminal Preferences
2. Use the gear icon at the bottom of the profile selector, and select "Importâ€¦".
3. Import the theme you'd like, and select it.
4. Done.

## Git
A basic gitconfig file I use. Copy this file to `~/.gitconfig`, or copy/paste what you want from here into your existing `.gitconfig` file. Basically, it adds:

* Color coding
* A few shortcut aliases
* Setup for using [P4Merge][p4] as your mergetool
* [Atom][atom] as your default editor

## Finder
QuickLook is pretty handy, but it can be pretty dumb at times, and isn't that useful if it doesn't recognize a file's extension, or if a file doesn't have one. The [QLStephen plugin][ql_1] is great for cases like this. If the file you're trying to take a look at is a plaintext file, you'll get a preview you can actually look at in Finder.

## Xcode Tools

Xcode Snippets are awesome. NSHipster has a [great article][xcode_1] on installing and using them, as well as a repo of useful snippets.

### Plugins
Xcode also has a relatively unknown plugin mechanism. [Alcatraz][xcode_2] exists to make using these plugins easier and more common. Currently I use the following plugins:

* BBUDebuggerTuckAway
* CocoaPods
* DerivedData Exterminator
* OpenInTerminal
* SCXcodeSwitchExpander
* VVDocumenter-Xcode

These plugins can all be found using Alcatraz from within Xcode.
