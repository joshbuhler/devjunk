Small collection of dev junk I find useful and tend to setup on each of my dev machines.




## Xcode Color Themes
Themes that I like and use on a regular basis. Currently using the Dusk - Custom theme. (Real original name, right?)

### Installing themes
1. Themes should be installed in Xcode's `FontAndColorThemes` folder (`~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/`).
2. Restart Xcode.
3. Enjoy.
