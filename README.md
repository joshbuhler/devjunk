devjunk
=======

Small collection of dev junk I find useful and tend to setup on each of my dev machines. Color themes, scripts, config files, etc. Everything is grouped into different folders, and some basic info about what's there is listed below.

## Git
A basic gitconfig file I use. Copy this file to `~/.gitconfig`, or copy/paste what you want from here into your existing `.gitconfig` file. Basically, it adds:

* Color coding
* A few shortcut aliases
* Setup for using [P4Merge][p4] as your mergetool
* [Atom][atom] as your default editor


## ColorThemes

### Xcode
Themes that I like and use on a regular basis. Currently using the Dusk - Custom theme. (Real original name, right?)

#### Installing themes
1. Themes should be installed in Xcode's `FontAndColorThemes` folder (`~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/`).
2. Restart Xcode.
3. Enjoy.


### Terminal
Themes that I like and use on a regular basis. Currently using "The Grid", a theme I created inspired by Tron Legacy.

#### Installing themes
1. Open the "Profiles" tab in Terminal Preferences
2. Use the gear icon at the bottom of the profile selector, and select "Importâ€¦".
3. Import the theme you'd like, and select it.
4. Done.
